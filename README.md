# 🎨 Ethniq – AI Powered Art & Culture Collaboration Platform  

Ethniq is a **GenAI-powered mobile app** built during the GenAI Hackathon to bridge the gap between **local artists, craft enthusiasts, and global audiences**. It leverages cutting-edge AI, AR/VR, and cloud technologies to preserve cultural heritage, empower artists, and deliver immersive experiences for users.

## 🚀 Problem We Solve  
Traditional art & crafts often remain **undiscovered**, with artists struggling to reach wider audiences. Current platforms either focus only on **AI-art generation**, **freelance marketplaces**, or **portfolios**, but **none integrate collaboration, AI assistance, and cultural storytelling**.
